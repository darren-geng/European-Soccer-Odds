# European-Soccer-Odds
Comparing betting odds with various probability estimates from multiple classifiers.

A small ongoing project where I analyze a large dataset of European soccer games, and try to draw meaningful conclusions from them using machine learning methods.


Download the dataset from: kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer if you want to run the notebook for yourself (GitHub does not allow filesizes above 100mb to be pushed). Simply place the database in the same folder as the notebook and you're good to go (make sure you have the required packages installed!)
